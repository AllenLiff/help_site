<p id="cheryl_signature">Cheryl Lohrmann,
  <br>Executive Director<br>Create Plenty</p>
  <br><br>

  <p class="cheryl_message_bold">A historic opportunity:</p><p>Portland is poised to become a national leader in the teaching of climate literacy and justice. Thank-you to the PPS School Board for adopting the country's most far-reaching policy on teaching climate justice in the school.</p>
<br>
<p class="cheryl_message_bold">Imagine:</p><p>In my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/g7fzLqOSndA?start=1400&end=1589&amp;autoplay=1">testimony</a> before the school board, I call on them to imagine:<br>
<ul class="imagine_list">
<li>High school mentors working with K-8 school student gardens to be productive and benefit the community year-round.</li>

<li>School grounds better managed in an environmentally sustainable manner, with climate change threats guiding new policies and serving as an outdoor classroom and a model for the state and the nation.</li>

<li>The year of the climate where teachers come together to seek best practices for teaching about climate change and its social implications.</li>

<li>High school students earning class credit for learning the technical, leadership and community building skills they will need for the future we are now in.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p class="cheryl_message_bold">The High School Environmental Leadership Project (HELP):</p>
<p>Create Plent is embarking on an ambitious three-year plan to implement the resolution in all nine of Portland's high schools. We can’t leave climate education and justice to chance. We, the community, must collaborate with the school district. This will involve all our voices and talents. That is our vision for HELP.

<br><br>
<p class="cheryl_message_bold">What you can do to help:</p><p>How can you, as a parent, community leader or business person help?

high school environmental activists.</li>
